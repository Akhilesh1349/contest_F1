                The beagle is a breed of small scent hound, similar in appearance to the much larger foxhound. 
                The beagle was developed primarily for hunting hare, known as beagling. Possessing a great sense 
                of smell and superior tracking instincts, the beagle is 
                    primary breed used as a detection dog 
                for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. The beagle is 
                intelligent and is a popular pet due to its size, good temper, and a lack of inherited health problems.
                The modern breed was developed in Great Britain around the 1830s from several breeds, including the Talbot Hound, 
                the North Country Beagle, the Southern Hound, and possibly the Harrier.
